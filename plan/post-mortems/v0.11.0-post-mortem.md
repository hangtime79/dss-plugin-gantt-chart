# Post-Mortem: v0.11.0

**Branch:** `feature/v0.11.0-defensive-programming`
**Type:** Feature
**Duration:** 2 days (Started: 2025-12-29, Completed: 2025-12-30)
**Outcome:** ✅ Success

---

## Summary

Implemented three defensive programming features: Getting Started Guide (#77), enhanced duplicate ID handling (#76), and dependency status warnings (#83). All features delivered and tested. The Getting Started Guide evolved from a simple loading state enhancement to a comprehensive 5-section onboarding overlay.

## Scope

### Planned
- [x] #77 - Improved loading/empty states
- [x] #76 - Enhanced ID uniqueness handling
- [x] #83 - Missing dependency warnings

### Delivered
- [x] #77 - Getting Started Guide (5 sections, auto-hide, interactive tabs)
- [x] #77 - Empty Dataset State (inline SVG icon)
- [x] #76 - Duplicate ID handling (rename/skip modes, structured metadata)
- [x] #76 - Mode-specific warning banner and tooltip
- [x] #83 - Dependency status in tooltips (filtered/missing)
- [x] #83 - Dismissible dependency warning banner

### Deferred Items
None

## Commit Analysis

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total commits | 13 | |
| Feature commits | 4 | |
| Fix/debug commits | 7 | |
| Docs commits | 2 | |
| Churn ratio | 54% | 🟡 Medium-High |

**Churn Explanation:** High churn was due to icon implementation iterations. FontAwesome icons don't work in Dataiku webapp context (discovered gotcha), requiring multiple commits to switch to inline SVG icons. This is expected exploration, not rework.

---

## What Went Well

- **Getting Started Guide scope expansion**: Original spec called for simple loading messages, but the implementation evolved into a much more valuable onboarding experience
- **Reusable patterns**: Warning banner pattern from #76 was reused for #83
- **Clean separation**: Python handles duplicate detection, JS handles display - maintained architecture boundaries
- **QA feedback loop**: Immediate user testing caught control bar/container visibility issue quickly

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- **Icon approach iteration**: Attempted FontAwesome, then custom SVG, multiple size adjustments - 5 commits for icon work alone
- **Incomplete initial hiding**: First attempt only hid control bar, not the gantt container with date headers

---

## Blockers Encountered

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution | Time Lost |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|
| FontAwesome not available in webapp | Icons not rendering | Switch to inline SVG | ~1 hour |

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Platform Behavior
- **Webapp icons require inline SVG**: FontAwesome classes (`fas fa-*`) don't work in Dataiku webapp context. Must use inline SVG with `fill="currentColor"` for theme compatibility.

### Library Behavior
- None new this release

### Architecture Insights
- **Getting Started as overlay**: Using a full-page overlay with `display: none` toggle is cleaner than trying to show/hide multiple elements. The gs-* prefixed classes keep it isolated.

---

## CLI Docs Candidates

Already documented in previous session:
1. **Webapp icons require inline SVG**: Added to CLAUDE.md gotchas

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Release
- Consider adding Getting Started Guide link/help button for users who dismissed it

### Process Improvements
- Test icon rendering approach early when adding new visual elements

### Technical Debt
- None introduced

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Scope expansion can be positive**: The Getting Started Guide is more valuable than the original loading state spec
2. **Platform limitations surface during implementation**: Always test visual elements in actual Dataiku context early
3. **Overlay hiding needs to be comprehensive**: When showing an overlay, hide ALL underlying content, not just some of it

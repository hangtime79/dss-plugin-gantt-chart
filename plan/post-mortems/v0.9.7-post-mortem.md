## What Went Well

- Spec-first approach enabled clean implementation
- Single commit for entire feature - no iteration needed
- Bonus dark mode fixes identified and resolved during QA
- User feedback integrated smoothly (spacing, today line color)

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- Nothing significant

---

## Blockers Encountered

None

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Library Behavior
- frappe-gantt uses `--g-today-highlight` CSS variable for both `.current-highlight` (line) and `.current-ball-highlight` (ball at top)
- Our custom `--chart-today-line` variable only affected `.today-highlight`, not the library's selectors

### Dark Mode
- Light-colored today indicator (#C7C7C7) requires dark text override for the date highlight
- CSS specificity: `.dark-theme .gantt-container .lower-text.current-date-highlight` needed to override existing white text rule

---

## CLI Docs Candidates

None - no new platform learnings requiring documentation.

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Release
- Continue spec-first approach - working well

### Process Improvements
- None needed - current process is efficient

### Technical Debt
- None introduced

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Consolidated commits are achievable with good planning
2. QA catches theming edge cases that aren't obvious during development
3. Library CSS variables sometimes need to be overridden alongside custom variables

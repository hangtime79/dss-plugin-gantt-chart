# Post-Mortem: v0.9.8

**Branch:** `feature/v0.9.8-task-filtering`
**Type:** Feature
**Duration:** 1 day (Started: 2025-12-29, Completed: 2025-12-29)
**Outcome:** ✅ Success

---

## Summary

Implemented task status filtering feature allowing users to filter the Gantt chart by task status (Completed, Overdue, In Progress, Not Started). Initial implementation used DOM hiding which was refactored to full re-render per user feedback to properly resize the chart container.

---

## Scope

### Planned
- [x] Filter buttons in control bar
- [x] Multiple selection with OR logic
- [x] Overdue overlap with In Progress/Not Started
- [x] Empty state for no matches
- [x] Dark mode support
- [x] Filter persistence across view changes

### Delivered
All planned items delivered.

### Deferred Items
None

The fix commit was expected iteration: initial implementation used DOM hiding (display:none) which didn't resize the chart. User correctly identified this as "hiding" rather than true filtering. Refactored to re-render approach.

---

## What Went Well

- Clean spec-to-implementation path
- All user-specified features delivered
- Quick turnaround on refactor request
- Re-render approach is more robust than DOM hiding

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- Initial approach (DOM hiding) was simpler but didn't meet UX expectation
- Should have anticipated that "filtering" implies chart resizing

---

## Blockers Encountered

None

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Implementation Pattern
- **DOM hiding vs re-render**: For filtering that should affect layout (chart height, grid size), re-render with filtered data is preferred over hiding DOM elements. DOM hiding keeps the original layout intact.

### State Management
- Storing `allTasks` separately from `currentTasks` allows filtering without re-fetching data
- Storing `lastGanttConfig` enables re-render without rebuilding config

---

## CLI Docs Candidates

None - no new platform learnings.

---

## Recommendations

### For Next Release
- Consider adding filter state to URL/localStorage for persistence across sessions

### Process Improvements
- When implementing "filter" functionality, default to re-render approach unless specifically need to preserve layout

### Technical Debt
- None introduced

---

## Lessons Learned

1. "Filtering" implies layout changes - users expect the chart to shrink when tasks are hidden
2. Re-render is more robust than DOM manipulation for filter state
3. Storing original data separately enables non-destructive filtering

## Root Cause Analysis
The original fix for scrolling (v0.1.0) relied on specific CSS rules for `.gantt-container` and JS logic in `app.js`. When `app.js` and `style.css` were deleted and restored during the "Duplicate File Resolution" event (v0.0.2/v0.1.0 transition), the restored files likely originated from a version *before* the scrolling fixes were fully hardened, or the specific CSS overrides were missed.

## Lessons Learned
1. **Regression Testing**: Manual verification of basic features like scrolling should be part of every release checklist.
2. **Code Restoration Risks**: When restoring files from backups or other locations, verify that they contain the *latest* patches, not just the base functionality.

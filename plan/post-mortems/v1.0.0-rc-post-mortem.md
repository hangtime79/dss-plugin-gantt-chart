## What Went Well

- **User-assisted implementation**: User modified webapp.json directly, reducing coordination overhead
- **Clean commit history**: Only 2 commits needed for entire release
- **Bonus fixes included**: Fixed #76 tooltip issue and dark mode arrows discovered during implementation
- **Fast turnaround**: From start to QA pass in <24 hours

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- Nothing significant - this was a straightforward cleanup release

---

## Blockers Encountered

None

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Platform Behavior
- None new (cleanup release, no new platform interactions)

### Library Behavior
- None new

### Architecture Insights
- Hardcoding always-on features (viewModeSelect, todayButton, theme) simplifies both code and UX

---

## CLI Docs Candidates

None - cleanup release with no new platform learnings

---

## Recommendations

### For v1.0.0 Release
- Verify all marketplace assets display correctly
- Consider final review of plugin.json metadata
- Prepare release announcement

### Process Improvements
- User-modified config files worked well for simple parameter reorganization

### Technical Debt
- None introduced
- 62 console.log and debug logging removed (debt paid off)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Cleanup releases benefit from minimal scope - do one thing well
2. User collaboration on config changes speeds up parameter reorganization
3. Bonus fixes (like #76 tooltip) should be documented even if not originally scoped

## What Went Well

- Quick investigation identified CSS `.big` class issue immediately
- User provided clear QA feedback that caught edge cases (0 = unlimited, re-render behavior)
- Workflow optimization was a quick win during PR wait time

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- Initially implemented row limit at data loading layer instead of display layer
  - User clarified preference for display-layer limiting to preserve backend data
  - Quick fix, no significant time lost

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Frappe Gantt Label Behavior
- Library automatically positions labels outside bars when they don't fit
- Adds `.big` class to these external labels
- Our CSS was forcing all labels to white, making external labels invisible

### GitHub Actions Queue
- Queue congestion was from triggering builds on every feature branch push
- Limiting to `main` + PRs significantly reduces queue wait times

---

## Lessons Learned

1. Check library CSS behavior before adding overrides
2. Display-layer limits are more flexible than data-loading limits
3. GitHub Actions workflow should be scoped to reduce noise

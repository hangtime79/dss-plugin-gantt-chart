# Post-Mortem: v0.7.2

**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.7.2-markers-and-zoom`
**Type:** Bugfix
**Duration:** <1 day (Started: 2025-12-27, Completed: 2025-12-27)
**Outcome:** ✅ Success

---

## Summary

Fixed expected progress marker alignment and improved zoom UX. Initial implementation over-engineered the marker calculation; user feedback led to much simpler solution using the existing Today line position.

---

## Scope

### Planned
- [x] Fix marker alignment at Hour/Day views (#52)
- [x] Add zoom preset functionality (#53)

### Delivered
- [x] Markers align perfectly using Today line X position
- [x] Zoom passes through mandatory stops (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%)
- [x] No maximum zoom limit

## What Went Well

- **User feedback improved solution:** Initial time-based marker calculation was complex; user suggested using Today line position - much simpler and guaranteed accurate
- **Quick iteration:** Single QA round passed
- **Clean implementation:** Minimal code changes, leveraged existing library elements

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- **Initial over-engineering:** First attempt calculated marker position using millisecond-precision time math when simply reading the Today line's X position was sufficient
- **Misunderstood zoom requirement:** Initially implemented zoom to ONLY use preset stops; user clarified they wanted 5px increments that MUST pass through stops

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Library Behavior
- **`.current-highlight` element:** frappe-gantt creates this div for the Today line with `left` style property containing the X position in pixels

### Architecture Insights
- **Reuse library calculations:** Instead of reimplementing date-to-pixel math, leverage existing DOM elements that already have correct positions

---

## CLI Docs Candidates

None - discoveries were implementation-specific, not generalizable gotchas.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplest solution is often best:** Using the Today line's existing position is more reliable than recalculating
2. **Clarify requirements early:** "Zoom stops" could mean "only stops" or "must pass through stops" - different implementations
3. **Leverage existing DOM:** The library already solved the date-to-pixel problem; reuse its solution

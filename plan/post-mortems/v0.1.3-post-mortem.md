## What Went Well

- The root cause was correctly identified in the v0.1.2 post-mortem, making this fix straightforward.
- `git log` analysis confirmed the history of the duplicate file.

---

## What Didn't Go Well

- `make unit-tests` failed due to environment configuration issues (`PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_TEST_INSTANCE`), though this did not block the frontend fix.

---

## Technical Discoveries

### Platform Behavior
- **Dataiku Auto-loading**: Confirmed that for `STANDARD` webapps, Dataiku automatically injects `webapps/<id>/app.js` into the iframe. Adding it manually to `body.html` causes it to run twice (once from injection, once from tag).

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Trust the Auto-loader**: In Standard webapps, do not manually include `app.js` in `body.html`.
2. **Clean up Legacy**: When moving files (e.g., from `resource/` to `webapps/`), immediately delete the old one to avoid confusion.

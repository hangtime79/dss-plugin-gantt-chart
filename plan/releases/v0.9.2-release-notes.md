# Release Notes: v0.9.2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-28
**Type:** Feature + Bugfix
**Branch:** `feature/v0.9.2-visual-polish`

---

## Summary

Visual polish release addressing three user-reported issues: inconsistent label positioning, off-center checkmarks, and overstated progress bars. Also fixes a regression where upper header showed wrong year when timeline spans multiple years with the same month name.

---

## Changes

### Added
- **Right-aligned labels (#62)**: All task labels now consistently appear to the right of bars
  - 45px offset from bar end
  - `.big` class applied for correct text styling
  - Works across all view modes (Day/Week/Month/Year)

- **Centered checkmarks (#63)**: Completion checkmarks now horizontally centered in task bars
  - True center calculation: `x + (width/2) - (scaledSize/2)`
  - Adapts color for light/dark themes

### Fixed
- **Progress bar accuracy (#64)**: Removed width extension that caused 50% progress to appear as 60-70%
  - clipPath alone now handles corner radius containment
  - Visual progress now accurately reflects percentage

- **Upper header year display**: Fixed wrong year showing when timeline spans multiple years
  - Root cause: Text-based month matching found first occurrence in dates array
  - Fix: Index-based lookup using element position (`dates[elementX / columnWidth]`)

### Changed
- Labels no longer shift when checkmark is added (labels already right-aligned)

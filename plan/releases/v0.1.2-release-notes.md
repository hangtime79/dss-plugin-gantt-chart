# Release Notes: v0.1.2

**Release Date:** 2025-12-20
**Type:** Bugfix
**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.1.2`

---

## Summary

This release fixes critical UI issues where appearance settings (bar height, column width, etc.) were not updating in real-time, and tasks were becoming invisible at finer time granularities (Day/Hour views). It also resolves a "dual execution" race condition caused by stale code being loaded by the browser.

---

## Changes

### Fixed
- **Appearance Settings Not Updating**: The webapp now uses live configuration messages from the Dataiku UI instead of making separate backend calls that returned stale data.
- **Invisible Tasks at High Zoom**: Enforced minimum bar widths during render and view changes to ensure tasks remain visible when switching to Day/Half-Day/Hour views.
- **Dual Execution Race Condition**: Consolidated code changes into `resource/webapp/app.js` (the file actually loaded by the browser) to prevent conflicting versions of the script from running simultaneously.

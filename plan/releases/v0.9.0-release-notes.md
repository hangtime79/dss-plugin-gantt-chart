# Release Notes: v0.9.0

**Release Date:** 2025-12-27
**Type:** Feature
**Branch:** `feature/v0.9.0-theming-and-visual-polish`

---

## Summary

This release adds configurable grid lines and fixes the zoom carryover bug between view modes. Originally planned as a larger theming release, scope was reduced during QA to ensure quality - dark mode, color palettes, markers, and label improvements are deferred to subsequent point releases.

---

## Changes

### Added
- **Grid Lines Configuration** (#34): New settings to show/hide vertical and horizontal grid lines with adjustable opacity
- **Theme dropdown in header**: UI preparation for dark mode (Light/Dark/Auto selector)
- **Control bar layout**: Spacer between theme selector and view controls for cleaner UI

### Fixed
- **Zoom carryover bug** (#54): View mode switching no longer carries zoom state between views - each view maintains independent zoom

### Changed
- Control bar layout: Theme dropdown positioned left of View Mode with spacing

# Release Notes: v0.7.1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-27
**Type:** Bugfix
**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.7.1-sticky-header-narrow-content`

---

## Summary

Fixes sticky header jankiness that occurred when Gantt chart content was narrower than the viewport. The solution uses dynamic zoom adjustment to ensure edge-to-edge content, eliminating browser paint/composite issues that caused choppy scrolling.

---

## Changes

### Fixed
- **Sticky header jank on narrow content** (#21): Chart now automatically zooms to fill viewport width
  - Per-view independent zoom tracking (each view mode remembers its column width)
  - Edge-to-edge enforcement ensures SVG content always spans container width
  - View floor calculation prevents zooming below the minimum needed to fill viewport

### Added
- **Zoom limit feedback**: User-visible banner when zoom limit is reached
  - "Zoom limit reached for [View] view" message appears briefly
  - Message positioned above chart to survive re-renders
- **Config panel spinner**: Visual feedback during configuration changes

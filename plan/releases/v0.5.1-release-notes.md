# Release Notes: v0.5.1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-26
**Type:** Bugfix
**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.5.1-visual-polish`

---

## Summary

Visual polish patch addressing two CSS issues identified after the v0.5.0 UI overhaul: removing the dated 1px outline around task bars, and fixing progress bar bleeding outside task bar corners.

---

## Changes

### Fixed
- **Task bar outline removed** (#27): Eliminated the 1px gray outline that gave task bars a dated appearance
- **Progress bar corner bleed** (#28): Progress bars no longer bleed outside task bar rounded corners
  - Implemented SVG clipPath solution to constrain progress bars to task bar boundaries
  - Progress bar corners now follow the task bar's curve for visual consistency

## Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `plugin.json` | Modified | Version bump 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 |
| `resource/webapp/style.css` | Modified | Added `outline: none` rule for task bars |

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Collection errors (test infrastructure issue, not related to this fix)
- **Manual Verification:**
  - Task bars have no gray outline/border
  - Progress bars don't bleed outside task bar corners
  - Works with color column selected and default gray bars
  - View mode changes don't break the fix

---

## Breaking Changes

None

---

## Known Issues

- Progress bar corners follow the task bar's curve (slightly rounded where they touch edges). This is the expected trade-off to prevent bleeding.

---

## Technical Notes

- ClipPath approach: Creates SVG `<clipPath>` elements matching each task bar's shape, applies to progress bars
- Progress bars extended beyond task bounds to fill corner pixels, then clipped to correct shape
- Fix runs on initial render AND on view mode change (bars are recreated by library)

# Release Notes: v0.1.3

**Release Date:** 2025-12-20
**Type:** Bugfix
**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.1.3`

---

## Summary

This release resolves a critical race condition where two instances of the Gantt chart application logic were executing simultaneously. This was caused by a duplicate script reference loading a deprecated file alongside the canonical one. The fix consolidates execution to a single source of truth.

---

## Changes

### Fixed
- **Dual Execution Race Condition**: Removed the redundant `<script>` tag in `body.html` that was loading `resource/webapp/app.js`.
- **Stale Code Execution**: Deleted the deprecated `resource/webapp/app.js` file to prevent any possibility of the browser loading outdated logic.

## Files Modified

| File | Change Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `webapps/gantt-chart/body.html` | Modified | Removed reference to resource/webapp/app.js |
| `resource/webapp/app.js` | Deleted | Removed deprecated file |
| `plugin.json` | Modified | Version bump to 0.1.3 |

---

## Testing

- **Manual Verification:**
  - [x] Verified only one "Gantt Chart webapp initializing..." log in console.
  - [x] Confirmed appearance settings update reliably without race conditions.
  - [x] Validated that `dku-helpers.js` still loads and functions correctly.

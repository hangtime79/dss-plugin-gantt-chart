# Release Notes: v0.9.8

**Release Date:** 2025-12-29
**Type:** Feature
**Branch:** `feature/v0.9.8-task-filtering`

---

## Summary

This release adds task status filtering to the Gantt chart, allowing users to focus on specific categories of work by showing only Completed, Overdue, In Progress, or Not Started tasks. Multiple filters can be combined with OR logic.

---

## Changes

### Added
- Task status filter buttons in control bar (#51)
  - Filter options: All, Completed, Overdue, In Progress, Not Started
  - Positioned to the right of "Project Timeline" brand title
  - Multiple selection with OR logic (e.g., Overdue + In Progress shows both)
  - Overdue tasks also appear when In Progress or Not Started filters active
- Empty state message when no tasks match selected filter(s)
- Dark mode styling for filter buttons

### Technical Details
- Status definitions:
  - **Completed:** progress === 100
  - **Overdue:** progress < 100 AND end_date < today
  - **In Progress:** progress > 0 AND progress < 100
  - **Not Started:** progress === 0
- Filtering triggers full chart re-render (not just DOM hiding) so container properly resizes
- Filter state persists across view mode changes

# Release v0.2.1

## Bug Fixes
- **Horizontal & Vertical Scrolling:** Restored scrolling functionality that was lost in previous refactoring.
  - The chart container now correctly handles overflow, ensuring scrollbars appear when the chart content exceeds the viewport dimensions.
  - Fixed an issue where the SVG element dimensions were not being correctly applied to the styles, preventing the browser from triggering scrollbars.

## Technical Details
- **CSS:** Updated container styles to use `overflow: hidden` on the outer wrapper and `overflow: auto` on the inner Frappe container.
- **JS:** Added `updateSvgDimensions()` to explicitly sync SVG attributes to CSS styles after rendering and view changes.

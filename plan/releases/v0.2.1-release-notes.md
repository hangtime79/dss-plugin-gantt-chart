# Release Notes: v0.2.1

**Release Date:** 2025-12-20
**Type:** Bugfix
**Branch:** `bugfix/v0.2.1-fix-horizontal-scrolling`

---

## Summary

Restored horizontal and vertical scrolling functionality for the Gantt chart. Users can now scroll to view tasks that extend beyond the visible viewport, and touchpad/mousewheel scrolling works correctly.

---

## Changes

### Fixed
- **Scrolling**: Horizontal and vertical scrollbars now appear when chart content exceeds viewport
  - Root cause: CSS was overriding Frappe Gantt's dynamic height calculation
  - Fix: Removed `.gantt-container { height: 100% }` override, let Frappe control its own sizing
  - Put `overflow: auto` on outer `#gantt-container` div

## Technical Details

### The Problem
Frappe Gantt uses a CSS variable `--gv-grid-height` to dynamically set the height of its `.gantt-container` div based on the number of task rows. Our CSS was overriding this with `height: 100%`, forcing the container to exactly match the viewport height and eliminating any overflow.

### The Fix
```css
/* Our container scrolls when Frappe's container exceeds viewport */
#gantt-container {
    overflow: auto;
}

/* Do NOT set height on .gantt-container - let Frappe control it */
```

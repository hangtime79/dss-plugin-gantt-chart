## Changes

### Added

- **Design System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
- **Control Bar**: New header bar with:
  - View mode dropdown (Hour, Quarter Day, Half Day, Day, Week, Month, Year)
  - Zoom in/out buttons with percentage indicator
  - Today button for quick navigation
  - Brand title with inline SVG icon
- **Skeleton Loader**: Modern animated placeholder during initial load (replaces spinner)
- **Progress-Based Default Colors**: When no color column is selected:
  - Gray base bar (`#f0f3f6`) with black text
  - Progress overlay darkens as completion increases (0% → 100%)
  - 100% complete tasks show green-tinted progress (`#8faa94`)
  - Progress bar renders at 60% of task height, centered

### Changed

- **Typography**: System font stack for premium appearance (air-gap safe, no external fonts)
- **Visual Polish**: Softer colors, rounded corners, lightened grid lines
- **Tooltips**: Card-style design with shadows and improved layout
- **Metadata Banner**: Now styled as floating toast notification
- **Error States**: Uses Dataiku's FontAwesome icons instead of emoji

### Fixed

- Progress bar now properly centered within task bars using SVG transform-box
